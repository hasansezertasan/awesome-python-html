## Motivation

> This section is written assuming you "use HTML for web development."

Why use Python to generate HTML...

* You lose type hints, editor support, auto-completion, and all the good stuff in Python when you use template engines.
* You create more files (HTML templates) and have to manage them. (You also might have to deal with the file system to manage overrides and such.)
* It's pythonic, a familiar syntax, and you can use all the Python features.
